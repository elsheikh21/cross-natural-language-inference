# Student: you can use this file to prepare your environment once (and avoid re-downloading every time you start test.sh)
# e.g. if you use transformers, nltk, spacy, etc you can download everything needed by adding the proper code here!
# all the code in here will be executed only once (unless you change this file or requirements.txt)
# NOTE: DO NOT put anything referring to your own files here (no imports from stud), it won't work!
# NOTE: DO NOT declare anything here that you want to use in your stud folder!
